# Synthetic-Aperature-Imaging

Using linear algebra and CV to selectively focus on objects in images with post-processing.

In this program we synthesize images with smaller depths of field thus making it appear to
have been taken from an expensive camera with a larger aperture, when it was actually captured
with an iphone video.
